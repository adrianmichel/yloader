This is a command line utility that can be used to generate one symbols file 
containing symbols from several sources:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p style="tab-stops: 45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt">
	any number of other symbols files</li>

	<p style="tab-stops: 45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt">
	Nasdaq, NYSE and/or Amex symbols downloaded from
	<a href="http://www.nasdaq.com">www.nasdaq.com</a> - note: some of the 
	downloaded symbols will be transformed to make them compatible with the 
	Yahoo symbol format.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For example, one may have different lists of symbols, each for a different 
portfolio. These lists can be stored in different files, and a larger list 
containing all of the symbols can be generated by this tool and fed to YLoader for data downloading.</p>
<p style="tab-stops: 45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt">
Also, symbols on the three exchanges are constantly modified, added and removed, 
and this tool can be used to make sure the lists for these exchanges are always 
up to date.</p>
<p style="tab-stops: 45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt">
The whole process of downloading the symbols for the exchanges, combining 
various symbols lists into one, and downloading the market data can be automated 
by invoking both these tools with the right parameters from the command line or 
from a batch file (a sample is provided in the installation directory). </p>

Here are the transformation rules currently used for the downloaded symbols:</p>

<div class="sample">
  / becomes -<br>
	^ becomes -P<br>
	: becomes -P
</div>

<p style="tab-stops: 45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt">
Even using these transformation rules, some of the downloaded symbols will still 
have no Yahoo equivalent. Please let us know if you any other such rules that will 
increase the number of symbols that are recognized by Yahoo! Finance and we'll 
incorporate them to the product.</p>
